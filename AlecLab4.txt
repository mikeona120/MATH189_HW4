## Pre Regression ##
#"plot" expects the explanatory/independent variable in the first column. We need to switch our explanatory variable "gain" to the first column.
dft = subset(df,select=c(2,1))
dfb = subset(df,select=c(2,1))

#Next we also need to transform our gain by passing it through a log
dft[,1] = log(dft[,1])
#Use the inline tool to plot
plot(dft)
plot(df)

## Regression ##
#Running the "lm" function generates a list of parameters for a line: intercept and slope
#The first input argument "formula" can be supplied with the "~" shorthand and indicates response~explanatory variables
fit = lm(formula=density~gain, data=dft)
#The output object has many hidden propoerties: most importantly has an intercept B0 and a scalar B1 of the independent x variable
#This lets us construct and plot a linear model that predicts y_hat slope using B0 intercept and B1 slope
plot(dft, main = "Least Squares fit to Logarithm of Gain", xlab = "Receiver Gain (log(keV))", ylab = "Calibration Foam Densities (g/cm^3)")
# xaxt='n', yaxt='n', asp=1, ylim = c(0,15),
#axis(side=1, at=seq(from=0,to = 230000, by = 23000)))
abline(fit, col="red")

fitb = lm(formula=density~gain, data=dfb)
plot(dfb, main = "Least Squares fit to Gain", xlab = "Receiver Gain (keV)", ylab = "Calibration Foam Densities (g/cm^3)")
abline(fitb, col="red")


## Diagnostics/Verification of Model ##
#To check for linearity we observe the scatter plot above
#To check that residuals are normal we plot a histogram(standard) and QQ line (better but harder to interpret)
hist(fit$residuals)
qqnorm(fit$residuals)#one of the hidden outputs of the lm() function is a calculation of each residual
qqline(fit$residuals, col="red")
#To check for homoscedasticity/constant data variability we observe the residual plot
plot(fit$residuals, main = "Residuals of Log Least Squares", xlab = "Sampled Data Points", ylab = "Residual") #one of the hidden outputs of the lm() function is a calculation of each residual
abline(0, 0, col="red")
